Hello team-member!

crates.io user octocat removed a "Trusted Publishing" configuration for GitHub Actions from a crate that you manage ("my-crate").

The removed configuration was for the workflow file at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/HEAD/.github/workflows/publish.yml.

If you did not make this change and you think it was made maliciously, you can email help@crates.io for assistance.
