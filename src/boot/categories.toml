# This is where the categories available on crates.io are defined. To propose
# a change to the categories, send a pull request with your change made to this
# file.
#
# For help with TOML, see: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml
#
# Format:
#
# ```toml
# [slug]
# name = "Display name"
# description = "Give an idea of the crates that belong in this category."
#
#  [slug.categories.subcategory-slug]
#  name = "Subcategory display name, not including parent category display name"
#  description = "Give an idea of the crates that belong in this subcategory."
# ```
#
# Notes:
# - Slugs are the primary identifier. If you make a change to a category's slug,
#   crates that have been published with that slug will need to be updated to
#   use the new slug in order to stay in that category. If you only change
#   names and descriptions, those attributes CAN be updated without affecting
#   crates in that category.
# - Slugs are used in the path of URLs, so they should not contain spaces, `/`,
#   `@`, `:`, or `.`. They should be all lowercase.
