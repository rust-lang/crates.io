      <p>
        To aid detection of unauthorized crate changes, we email you each time a new version of a crate you own is pushed.
        By receiving and reading these emails, you help protect the Rust ecosystem. You may also choose to turn these
        emails off for any of your crates listed below.

        To aid detection of unauthorized crate changes, we plan to email you each time a new version of a crate you own is
        pushed. This feature is still work-in-progress, if you want to help out have a look at
