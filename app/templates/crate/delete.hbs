      <p>
        A crate can only be deleted if it is not depended upon by any other crate on crates.io. (This is a temporary
        restriction due to
        <a
          href='https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/10538'
          target='_blank'
          rel='noopener noreferrer'

      </p>
      <p>Additionally, a crate can only be deleted if either:</p>
      <ol local-class='first'>
        <li>the crate has been published for less than 72 hours</li>
      </ol>
      <div local-class='or'>or</div>
      <ol start="2" local-class='second'>
        <li>
          <ol>
            <li>the crate only has a single owner, <em>and</em></li>
            <li>the crate has been downloaded less than 500 times for each month it has been published.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
