<PageHeader @title='Usage Policy' />

<TextContent @boxed={{true}}>
  <p><strong>Short version:</strong>
    <em>crates.io is a critical resource for the Rust ecosystem, which hosts a variety of packages from a diverse group of
    users. That resource is only effective when our users are able to work together as part of a community in good
    faith. While using crates.io, you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policies, which include some restrictions on
    content and conduct on crates.io related to user safety, intellectual property, privacy, authenticity, and other
    limitations. In short, be excellent to each other!</em></p>

    <li>contains malicious code, such as computer viruses, computer worms, rootkits, back doors, or spyware, including

      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>You are responsible for using crates.io in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and all of our policies.
    These policies may be updated from time to time. We will interpret our policies and resolve disputes in favor of
    protecting users as a whole. The crates.io team reserves the possibility to evaluate each instance on a case-by-case
    basis.</p>

  <p>For issues such as DMCA violations, or trademark and copyright infringements, the crates.io team will respect the
    legal decisions of the <a href='https://rustfoundation.org/'>Rust Foundation</a> as the official legal entity
    providing the crates.io service.</p>

  <h2 id='package-ownership'>Package Ownership</h2>

  <p>crates.io has a first-come, first-serve policy on crate names. Upon publishing a package, the publisher will be made
    owner of the package on crates.io.</p>

  <p>If you want to take over a package, we recommend you try and contact the current owner directly. If the
    current owner agrees, they can add you as an owner of the crate, and you can then remove them, if necessary.
    For security reasons, the crates.io team will not transfer ownership of existing crates without the explicit
    approval of the current owner.</p>

  <p>Crate deletion by their owners is not possible to keep the registry as immutable as possible. If you want to flag
    your crate as open for transferring ownership to others, you can publish a new version with a message in the README or
    description communicating to the crates.io support team that you consent to transfer the crate to the first person who
    asks for it:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I consent to the transfer of this crate to the first person who asks
    help@crates.io for it.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Keep in mind that the new owner might develop your crate in a way you never intended it, or might completely
    repurpose your crate. Transferring the crate to a malicious user could have a significant impact for any
    existing users of your crate.</p>

  <p>The crates.io team may delete crates from the registry that do not comply with the policies on this document. In
    larger cases of squatting attacks this may happen without prior notification to the author, but in most cases the team
    will first give the author the chance to justify the purpose of the crate.</p>

  <h2 id='data-access'>Data Access</h2>

  <p>Details on how to access the crates.io data can be found on the dedicated <LinkTo @route="data-access">Data Access
    Policy</LinkTo> page.</p>

  <h2 id='security'>Security</h2>

  <p>Please see the <LinkTo @route="policies.security">Security page</LinkTo>.</p>

  <h2 id='sexually-obscene-content'>Sexually Obscene Content</h2>

  <p>We do not tolerate content associated with sexual exploitation or abuse of another individual, including where minors
    are concerned. We do not allow sexually themed or suggestive content that serves little or no purpose other than to
    solicit an erotic or shocking response, particularly where that content is amplified by its placement in profiles or
    other social contexts.</p>

  <p>This includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pornographic content</li>
    <li>Non-consensual intimate imagery</li>
    <li>Graphic depictions of sexual acts including photographs, video, animation, drawings, computer-generated images, or
      text-based content
    </li>

    </ul>

  <p>We recognize that not all nudity or content related to sexuality is obscene. We may allow visual and/or textual
    depictions in artistic, educational, historical or journalistic contexts, or as it relates to victim advocacy. In some
    cases a disclaimer can help communicate the context of the project.</p>

  <h2 id='violations-and-enforcement'>Violations and Enforcement</h2>

  <p>crates.io retains full discretion to take action in response to a violation of these policies, including account
    suspension, account termination, or removal of content.</p>

  <p>We will however not be proactively monitoring the site for these kinds of violations, but instead relying on the
    community to draw them to our attention.</p>

  <p>While the majority of interactions between individuals in the Rust community falls within our policies, violations of
    those policies do occur at times. When they do, the crates.io team may need to take enforcement action to address the
    violations. In all cases, content and account deletion is permanent and there is no basis to reverse these moderation
    actions taken by the crates.io team. Account suspension may be lifted at the team's discretion however, for
    example in the case of someone's account being compromised.</p>

  <h2 id='reporting'>Reporting</h2>

  <p>Please report violations of this policy to <a href="mailto:help@crates.io">help@crates.io</a>.</p>
