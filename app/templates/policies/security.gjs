    <h2 id='crates-io-security'>Security of crates.io itself</h2>

    <p>Safety is one of the core principles of Rust, and to that end, we would like to ensure that cargo, crates.io,
      docs.rs, and related tools have secure implementations. To disclose security vulnerabilities in the crates.io
      service itself (as opposed to crates hosted on crates.io) or any other
      <a href='https://github.com/rust-lang'>repository in the rust-lang organization</a>, please follow the
      <a href='https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security'>Rust Security policy</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose any issues you find.</p>

    <h2 id='crate-security'>Security of crates hosted on crates.io</h2>

    <p>To disclose security vulnerabilities found in a crate that is hosted on crates.io, seek guidance from the
      individual crate's owners and their specific policies. Commonly, projects include a file named
      <code>SECURITY.md</code>
      that contains the crate's security policies and procedures.</p>

    <p>Intentionally malicious code is against
      <LinkTo @route='policies'>crates.io's usage policies</LinkTo>; please report crates violating these policies to
      <a href='mailto:help@crates.io'>help@crates.io</a>.</p>

    <h2 id='rustsec'>Rustsec Security Advisory Database for receiving security updates</h2>

    <p>The
      <a href='https://rustsec.org/'>Rustsec Security Advisory Database</a>
      maintains advisories about vulnerabilities in crates published on crates.io. Maintained by the
      <a href='https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/wgs/wg-secure-code'>Secure Code Working Group</a>, the information
      is available in a variety of forms to incorporate into your development practices. See
      <a href='https://rustsec.org/contributing.html'>their steps to submit a vulnerability to the database</a>.</p>

    <h2 id='ecosystem-security-help'>Ecosystem security help for crate authors</h2>

    <p>Security is a value important to the Rust ecosystem as a whole, not just to the Rust language. If you are a crate
      author and you have received a high impact/severity security bug report for your crate, the Rust Foundation and
      the Rust Project are available to help manage the situation. The Rust Project or the Rust Foundation may also be
      the ones reaching out to you, if they have been informed of a security issue.</p>

    <p>As part of its
      <a href='https://foundation.rust-lang.org/tags/security%20initiative/'>Security Initiative</a>, the Rust
      Foundation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Employs security engineers who can help assessing the problem, developing mitigations, and estimating impact.</li>
      <li>Has a network of member organizations that can help with testing resources and also employ security experts
        who can help with assessing and fixing issues.</li>
      <li>Employs communications staff who can manage publishing notifications and fielding inquiries.</li>
      <li>Has contacts with government agencies tasked with cybersecurity protections who may have information on
        exploitation or impact of a security problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Rust Project can coordinate actions among other parts of the ecosystem that may need to be updated to address
      a fix.</p>

    <p>Please reach out to
      <a href='mailto:contact@rustfoundation.org'>contact@rustfoundation.org</a>
      if either the Rust Project or the Rust Foundation can help you by providing security support in the areas listed
      above or in another way! These are just a few examples of the kind of help available to crate authors facing
      security challenges.</p>
