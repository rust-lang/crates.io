## ü¶Ä Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for [crates.io], the official package registry for the [Rust] programming language.

[crates.io] serves as a central registry for sharing "crates", which are packages or libraries written in [Rust] that you can use to enhance your projects. This repository contains the source code and infrastructure for the [crates.io] website, including both frontend and backend components.

This service is maintained for you by the [crates.io team], with support from the [Rust Foundation](https://rustfoundation.org/). File hosting is donated by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), with CDN services donated by [Fastly](https://fastly.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or improving documentation, your contributions help make [crates.io] better for everyone.

[crates.io] is built with [Rust] for the backend services. More specifically, the [axum] web framework and [diesel] for database access, with a [custom-built background worker system](./crates/crates_io_worker). The frontend is an [Ember.js] application written in JavaScript.

Please review our [contribution guidelines](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull request. The same document also contains instructions on how to set up a local development environment.
